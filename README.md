### Greetings fellow humans (and bots) 👋

I've been fairly quiet on GitHub of late.
My current job is heavily hands-on, so I'm spending my free time running and attempting to grow vegetables instead of making 1s and 0s happen.

### What I code
My professional experience is mostly split between Python, TypeScript and SQL.

If you want an idea of my coding style, then https://github.com/fredcollman/hat-game is probably the most representative.
For whatever reason, I don't have a ton of Python code exposed to the public. https://github.com/fredcollman/lyricsearch shows some basic bits and pieces.

### You should hire me
You should!

For my next role,
🌎 I want to have a real positive impact in the world, like taking action on the climate crisis or enabling fairer access to education around the world
🤔 I want to work somewhere that welcomes my curiosity, empowering me to dig deep and understand the less obvious aspects of the problem at hand
👷 I want to work in a primarily technical capacity, but not necessarily fully "hands-on" - I have plenty to offer as a mentor, designer, researcher and general collaborator

🐂 Bonus points if you're based here in Oxford!

The best way to get in touch with me about that kind of thing would be LinkedIn - https://www.linkedin.com/in/fred-c/ . I never thought I would write that sentence, but I guess everybody sells out eventually.
